        <h2>Beebe Lake</h2>
        <p>If you're around north campus, the best place to visit would be Beebe Lake. At its peek foliage, the view is
        simply mesmerizing. You can go canoeing in the lake or walk around it. The trail is relatively short and you can take many
      pictures by Sackett bridge. There is a also a shorter loop past the bridge that leads to a picnic area overlooking a waterfall.
    There are many picturesque views if you explore further, such as the Fall Creek Gorge and the falls over Beebe Dam. </p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>A legend says that if a couple walks around the entire perimeter of Beebe Lake while holding hands, the two are destined to be engaged.</p>

        scenery below. Despite all of the stairs and stone trails leading up to it, Cascadilla is definitely a place you must visit. The trail is relatively short
      and spans about 1.3 miles.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The gorge ascends over 400 ft and was constructed in the 1920s. </p>
